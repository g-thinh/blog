## Intro

Hey I'm Thinh, and this is my blog.

## Getting Started

Nothing much to it, simply run a `yarn` command at the root to install everything, followed by the typical
`yarn dev` to start the app in local development.

## What packages am I using?

The app was built with a Next.js TypeScript boilerplate with a lot of frontend goodies from the [Modulz](https://www.modulz.app/) team, notably [Radix-UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) an unstyled component library, [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) for the color palettes, and of course [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) as my CSS-in-JS solution.

I'm also using [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) to bundle my MDX files with SSG provided by Next.js.
