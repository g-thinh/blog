## The Story So Far

In 2020, during the covid-19 pandemic, I decided to return to my alma-mater to enroll myself in a web development bootcamp run by
[Concordia Bootcamps](https://concordiabootcamps.ca/courses/web-development-full-time/) to take a shot at what I consider to be my lifelong career.

Fast-forward a year later, I started working as a frontend developer at [CBC/Radio-Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/medias-numeriques/a-propos/)
in their Digital Media division based here in Montreal, where I am constantly learning about what it takes to develop accessible web apps
for a nation-wide audience.

## About Me

Born in the Great North ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, I had the opportunity to grow up on both sides of the Canadian coast in the cities of Vancouver and Montreal, the latter
being where I currently live.

In my spare time, I collaborate on an app for the non-profit organization [YAPHA](https://www.yahpa.org/), and offer [tutoring services](https://calendly.com/gthinh-nguyen) for students enrolled at Concordia Bootcamps.

    <Accordion.Trigger>Why did I decide to change careers?</Accordion.Trigger>
    <Accordion.Content>
      In my previous career I worked as a Workforce Management analyst, where I
      discovered coding to be my favourite aspect of the job. From building
      small utility applications in Python, I felt motivated to take this
      newfound passion to the next step by enrolling myself at a coding bootcamp.

    <Accordion.Trigger>What did I learn in the coding bootcamp?</Accordion.Trigger>
    <Accordion.Content>
      The bootcamp specialized in teaching the fundamentals of web development with
      JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 to eventually understand the full-stack nature of building
      applications with React and NodeJS, along with a NoSQL database such as Firebase or MongoDB.
      It was a unique learning experience made even better by having [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) 
      as my instructor.

      During the six months I spent coding, I was able work on:

      - A [mini kanban board](https://cb-kanban-mintbean.vercel.app/), while participating
      in a Hackathon aimed at bootcamp students hosted by [Mintbean](https://mintbean.io/meets?sort=upcoming).
      - [Wearabology](https://vercel.com/g-thinh/project-wearabology), an eCommerce application
      built with my teammates for our group project.
      - [Muvistack](https://project-muvistack.vercel.app/), an application made to match users 
      with similar movie preferences using the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-CA).

    <Accordion.Trigger>What did I study before?</Accordion.Trigger>
    <Accordion.Content>
      I graduated in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science specializing in
      Statistics from Concordia University. I had previously pursued a career in
      the actuarial field until I decided it was not meant for me.

    <Accordion.Trigger>How did I build this blog?</Accordion.Trigger>
    <Accordion.Content>
      Through trial and error while exploring some of my now favourite design system libraries with **Next.js**. This iteration was
      built using [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) and with [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) from the amazing devs over at Modulz.

      My first personal website started in React and `styled-components`, and after learning about other CSS-in-JS
      libraries, I went on to build a version using `Theme-UI`, the spiritual successor of `styled-system`.
