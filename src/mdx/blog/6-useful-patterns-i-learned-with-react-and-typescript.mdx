In the early stages of learning TypeScript, I found it difficult to write React the way I used to
with good ol' JavaScript, until I started to realize the significant gains I had in code hygiene
and readability by using some of these well known patterns.

## 1. Typing the implicitly rendered Children

Working with the implicitly passed `children` children in React is a must, and TypeScript can make
this much more explicit and type-safe with this super easy interface provided with the `React` namespace.

```tsx
function ExampleComponent(props: React.PropsWithChildren<{}>) {
  return <div>{props.children}</div>;
}
```

Of course, `PropsWithChildren` is a generic function, so you can add any additional types there.

## 2. Compound Components with JSX Dot Notation

I was introduced to this pattern early on when building UI components that share a common concern
or state, where these components can be written in a way that makes them more closely related.
Take for example a typical dropdown menu, it could look like this:

```tsx
import Menu from "components/Menu";

function DropdownExample() {
  return (
    <Menu>
      <Menu.Toggle />
      <Menu.Content>
        <Menu.ContentItem />
        <Menu.ContentItem />
        <Menu.ContentItem />
      </Menu.Content>
    </Menu>
  );
}
```

This approach provides the benefit of being able to localize state via the outermost component
`Menu`, which acts as a `Context` provider, and sharing it to the descendants without having to
pass it along as props.

Writing these components is also quite simple with [JSX dot notation](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)
which is a vanilla React feature. While dot notation is usually associated with the common way to
access object properties in JavaScript, in React it can be quite a handy tool, afterall a React
element is an object itself.

Taking the example of a dropdown Menu, we can follow the idea closely with this highly abstracted
snippet.

```tsx
import { MenuProvider, useMenu } from "context/MenuContext";

export default function Menu(props: React.PropsWithChildren<{}>) {
  return (
    <MenuProvider>
      <div>{props.children}</div>
    </MenuProvider>
  );
}

//We can use dot notation right away to define a new
//compound component, similar to assigning a new object property
Menu.Toggle = function MenuToggle() {
  const { isOpen, toggle } = useMenu();
  return <button onClick={toggle}>{isOpen ? "Close" : "Open"}</button>;
};

Menu.Content = function MenuContent(props: React.PropsWithChildren<{}>) {
  const { isOpen } = useMenu();
  return isOpen && <ul>{props.children}</ul>;
};

Menu.ContentItem = function ContentItem(props: React.PropsWithChildren<{}>) {
  return <li>{props.children}</li>;
};
```

## Favour Conditional Rendering with JSX Over Conditional Styles

When it came to visually hiding a component, I would often write code that looks like this:

```tsx
type Props = {
  showComponent: boolean;
};

//‚ùå Not ideal
function HiddenComponent(props: Props) {
  return (
    <section style={{ display: props.showComponent ? "block" : "none" }}>
      <p>Some Hidden Text</p>
    </section>
  );
}

//‚úÖ Much better
function IdeallyHiddenComponent(props: Props) {
  return (
    props.showComponent && (
      <section>
        <p>Some Hidden Text</p>
      </section>
    )
  );
}
```

As I came to learn later, this is not the best way especially when you consider
performance or accessibility. While it's not a huge hit to performance, hidden DOM
nodes can pollute your HTML if the page is already heavy, and for accessibility it is not
great to visually hide content that should be accessible to screen readers.

This [article](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/see-no-evil-hidden-content-and-accessibility/) provides
the best explanation on what approach to use when dealing with visually hidden but accessible components.

## 4. Easily Obtain Component Props Types

Oten times, I start writing type definitions related to the component inside the same file. Some might prefer
to keep these definitions in another tidy types-only file because it would be readily available as an export.

But in the case where you do not wish to extend the definition, but merely reuse it, you can easily retrieve the
definition of the component's props defintion using the `React.ComponentProps<>` generic class.

```tsx
import SomeComponent from "components/SomeComponent";

export default function AnotherComponent(
  props: React.ComponentProps<typeof SomeComponent>
) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Some Extra Text</p>
      <SomeComponent {...props} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

While this might seem like a quick shortcut over exporting the type and importing it where you might need it, this
approach can be useful when the original type definition is not readily available, while still offering the possibility
to extend the definition if need be.

## 5. Spread Your Props Whenever Possible To Maximize Reusability

While working with React, I found myself often wishing a certain `ComponentA` had the same React API event props
readily available like `onMouseOver` or `onKeyDown`, especially when it is being used in a different context.

```tsx
type ButtonProps = {
  onClick: () => void;
};

function LimitedButton(props: ButtonProps) {
  return <button onClick={props.onClick}>Click Me</button>;
}

// üêû TypeScript won't like this at all
function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <LimitedButton
      onClick={() => console.log("Hello")}
      onMouseOver={() => console.log("You are hovering on me")}
    />
  );
}
```

So in this fictional dilemma, where you would want to rely on the well typed `onMouseOver` API from React
to add an additional callback onto your button component, you simply can't.

  alt="Classic but censored scene with Samuel L. Jackson playing as an angry TypeScript server"
  objectFit="fit"
  ratio={16 / 9}
  css={{ margin: "0 2rem" }}
/>

Fortunately, this can be easily achieved by using the previous lesson's `React.ComponentProps` generic to
have a wider definition for the component props.

```tsx
type ButtonProps = React.ComponentProps<"button">;

function SuperButton(props: ButtonProps) {
  return <button {...props}>Click Me</button>;
}

// üéâ This button does it all
function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <SuperButton
      onClick={() => console.log("Hello")}
      onMouseOver={() => console.log("You are hovering on me")}
      onKeyDown={(e) => console.log("You pressed", e.key)}
    />
  );
}
```

By having a broader definition for the props and by spreading said props into a component, we end
up with a versatile and reusable component.

## 6. Replacing The JSX Component Type Conditionally with Type Guards

Occasionally, we would like to substitute our underlying React component with an alternative component
based on a certain condition. Take for example a `<Button/>` component, perhaps we would like to render
a link in the presence of an `href` attribute, and a regular `button` when that attribute is not added.

We can take advantage of how JSX tags renderering works, by simply applying a condition to what
component gets rendered. Remember that React components are **capitalized** and must be in-scope, that
is they must be declared before being passed into the tags.

```tsx
type ButtonProps = React.ComponentProps<"a">;

function Button(props: ButtonProps) {
  const Component = props.href ? "a" : "button";
  //‚ùå but wait, here we catch a TypeScript error when we spread our props
  return <Component {...props}>{props.children}</Component>;
}
```

While this compiles with JavaScript, this is not acceptable with the type definition we gave to `ButtonProps`,
because the attributes for an anchor tag and button tag do not overlap so neatly (easiest example being that
`button` does not typically receive the `href` attribute).

This is where type guards come in handy, as it allows us to pass the appropriate type definition on `props` based
on a condition, which is the presence of `href` in the example above.

```tsx
type ButtonProps = React.ComponentProps<"button">;
type AnchorProps = React.ComponentProps<"a">;

//This type guard will check the presence of `href`
function isPropsForAnchorElement(
  props: ButtonProps | AnchorProps
): props is AnchorProps {
  return "href" in props;
}

function Button(props: ButtonProps | AnchorProps) {
  if (isPropsForAnchorElement(props)) {
    return <a {...props} />;
  }
  return <button {...props} />;
}
```

> documentation.

And voil√†, we have ourselves a versatile component that can used to render links or buttons!
While JSX tags are an amazing part of React, we must also be careful in how we use this pattern
since it can leave us with un-safe code, and luckily that is where TypeScript can really help out
by providing tools that can allow us to use this cool pattern.

## As Always, Give Me The TL;DR;

Here is a brief summary of each pattern I wrote about.

1. Always use the `React.PropsWithChildren<{}>` generic when you need to explicitly type the `children` prop.
2. The compound components pattern with JSX dot notation offer's a great way to share component
   state and concern in a single exported component made up of several smaller components.
3. Don't use `display: none` as a crutch for visually hiding elements.
4. Reach for `React.ComponentProps` when you need to infer the type definition of a component's props.
5. Don't forget to think about spreading props to the outermost element in your component to really extend it's re-usability and styling potential.
6. You can render two different components, and still have type-safety with type guards.

React and TypeScript offers an incredibly amazing developer experience when authoring UI components
and these patterns only offer a glimpse of what can be achieved lately while building apps for the web.
