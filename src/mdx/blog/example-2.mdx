While exploring _JAMstack_ **applications**, `I came across` the thought of rebuilding my
React portfolio website into a full fledged Next.js application with Statically
Generated content that I could manage through a [headless CMS](https://www.storyblok.com/).

1. Oranges
2. Apples

After going through a bunch of different approaches as to how I asda sd as asda das rebuild by
portfolio website, I started thinking about how I wanted to also write blog posts
about code I come across, the idea finally solidified after exploring Storyblok
and Next.js for my frameworks of choice.In fact, while this blog was being
built, the team over at Storyblok published this amazingly well-timed guide on
how to integrate their CMS to a Next.js framework.

## Setting Up The Boilerplate For the Project

Next.js is a framework built on React, and `provides` incredible out-of-the-box
features that make it easier for developers to create full-stack applications.
Page routing and API routes are highly opinionated so there is little to
configure, underneath the hood the app will be running an express server.

Additionally, it can be easily hosted on Vercel (the team that built Next.js)
for additional optimizations. The ability to statically generate dynamic pages
according to specifications built on Storyblok was also another selling point
for me and felt like the most natural way to build the application.

```tsx filename="awesome.js" hl="8" showlineNumbers
export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [colorMode, rawSetColorMode] = React.useState(getInitialColorMode);
  const setColorMode = (value) => {
    rawSetColorMode(value);
    // Persist it on update
    window.localStorage.setItem("color-mode", value);
  };
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ colorMode, setColorMode, testing }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

## This is the end
