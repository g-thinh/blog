While building this blog, I found the combination of Next.js and Theme-UI to be
absolutely amazing with the former providing a top-of-the-class routing solution
and the latter bringing consistency and a source of truth to your CSS by
creating an interface to your code and design system. If you are interested in
giving this a go, then let's move on! Otherwise, feel free to grab the repo
[here.](https://github.com/g-thinh/nextjs-themeui-ts-template)

## Installing Next.js

Like any typical project, we start off with a `create-next-app` command followed
by a few depedencies for enabling Typescript and linting.

```
npx create-next-app nextjs-themeui-project
yarn add -D typescript @types/node @types/react
touch tsconfig.json
```

Next.js will automatically fill in the `tsconfig` with some defaults once you
run `next dev` so now we can start writing some typescript starting with
replacing the current pages with our own `_app.tsx` and `_document.tsx`.

```tsx hl="4"
// pages/_app.tsx
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}
```

This is where we will introduce the `ThemeProvider` from Theme-UI to our app,
additionally, Theme-UI uses [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/ssr#nextjs) under
the hood, which currently provides Server side rendering (SSR) capabilities out
of the box with little to no configuration.

```tsx
// pages/_document.tsx
import Document, {
  Html,
  Head,
  Main,
  NextScript,
  DocumentContext,
} from "next/document";

export default class AppDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx: DocumentContext) {
    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);
    return { ...initialProps };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head>
          <title>Nextjs + ThemeUI</title>
          <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}
```

And of course, to actually render a page, we can start off with a simple
`index.tsx` page.

```tsx
// pages/index.tsx
import Head from "next/head";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>Nextjs + ThemeUI</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>
      <h1>My Theme-UI Project</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> Next.js relies on a file-routing based system which means you should name your
> pages according to the folder hierarchy. For more info see
> [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)

## Adding Theme-UI

At this point, we are now set to install our Theme-UI library with the command
`yarn add theme-ui`. Once installed, we will need to update our files to
interface with the API as well as add a `theme.ts` file to hold all of our
design tokens, which are basically keys and values of CSS we would want to use.
The documentation provides a few themes in this [demo](https://theme-ui.com/demo/)
to get started. We'll pick my personal favorite, `deep`!

You can know delete any `css` files under the styles folder, and replace it with
your theme file.

```ts
// styles/theme.ts
import type { Theme } from "theme-ui";

export const theme: Theme = {
  colors: {
    text: "hsl(210, 50%, 96%)",
    background: "hsl(230, 25%, 18%)",
    primary: "hsl(260, 100%, 80%)",
    secondary: "hsl(290, 100%, 80%)",
    highlight: "hsl(260, 20%, 40%)",
    purple: "hsl(290, 100%, 80%)",
    muted: "hsla(230, 20%, 0%, 20%)",
    gray: "hsl(210, 50%, 60%)",
  },
  fonts: {
    body: 'system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif',
    heading: "inherit",
    monospace: "Menlo, monospace",
  },
  fontSizes: [12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 72],
  fontWeights: {
    body: 400,
    heading: 700,
    display: 900,
  },
  lineHeights: {
    body: 1.5,
    heading: 1.25,
  },
};
```

We will take a look at what these tokens represent in later post, for now we have
our theme ready to be consumed. Similar to most CSS-in-JS solutions, Theme-UI
comes with a `ThemeProvider` context that will inject our tokens where they are
needed. We can do so by tweaking our `_app.tsx` file like so.

```tsx hl="3,4,8...11" showLineNumbers
// pages/_app.tsx
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { ThemeProvider } from "@theme-ui/core";
import { theme } from "../styles/theme";

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

Next, we will need to add a script to avoid one of the modern web's biggest
annoyances, the dreaded [Flash of Incorrect Theme](https://css-tricks.com/flash-of-inaccurate-color-theme-fart/)
caused by server side rehydration of markup. This is a pretty big issue if you
want a painless dark mode experience, and fortunately Theme-UI solves that problem
in a typical one-liner fashion. Alot of great minds have put together their thoughts
on this, which I'll share at the end, but for now simply add this line. Even
though our theme hasn't been setup for a Dark mode, it can be done so at a later
time without too much hassle.

```tsx showLineNumbers hl="9, 27"
// pages/_document.tsx
import Document, {
  Html,
  Head,
  Main,
  NextScript,
  DocumentContext,
} from "next/document";
import { InitializeColorMode } from "@theme-ui/color-modes";

export default class AppDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx: DocumentContext) {
    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);
    return { ...initialProps };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head>
          <title>Nextjs + ThemeUI</title>
          <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
          <InitializeColorMode />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}
```

And there you have it, Theme-UI is now fully integrated to your Next.js project,
ready to build beautifully themed components.

## What Now? Where's My UI?

Before jumping into building UI components, it's always a best practice to be
familiar with the API you will interacting with. Luckily, the folks behind
Theme-UI sought out to create the best developper experience possible, especially when it comes to
code hygiene which is achieved through typescript support and practical utility
functions for styling components on the fly.

I'd love to share my tips and tricks in another tutorial, but this short and sweet
[documentation](https://theme-ui.com/api) should be enough to get started. I hope
to write posts about some of the UI components I've built for my blog.

This concludes most of the tutorial, you can check out the repo on my
[github](https://github.com/g-thinh/nextjs-themeui-ts-template). The following
contains a few goodies I've found useful when working with this setup.

## Bonus: Global Resets

Every good project should start with a CSS global styles ðŸŒŽ. This can be done in
a number of ways, but since Theme-UI comes with `emotion` we can make use of its
`<Global/>` component to create our own CSS reset.

```tsx 
// styles/Reset.tsx
import { css, Global, GlobalProps } from "@emotion/react";

export function Reset(props: GlobalProps) {
  return (
    <Global
      {...props}
      styles={css`
        html,
        body {
          padding: 0;
          margin: 0;
          font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen,
            Ubuntu, Cantarell, Fira Sans, Droid Sans, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;
        }

        a {
          color: inherit;
          text-decoration: none;
        }

        * {
          box-sizing: border-box;
        }
      `}
    />
  );
}
```

Importing this into our `_app.tsx` file will do just the trick!

```tsx showLineNumbers hl="5,10"
// pages/_app.tsx
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { ThemeProvider } from "@theme-ui/core";
import { theme } from "../styles/theme";
import { Reset } from "../styles/Reset";

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Reset styles />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## Bonus: Gimme Some Lint

If we are truly striving for the best DX _(Developer eXperience)_, then we definitely
need some linting going on! One of my favourite ways of doing this is actually with
a few extra lines in the `package.json` file. As of [Next.js 11](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-11),
the framework now comes with ESLint support in by way of a library. Next.js is
a fairly opinionated framework with stricter rules surrounding certain use-cases.
It previously relied on a bunch of eslint packages to do that work. Now we only
need a single package ðŸ”¥.

```
yarn add -D eslint eslint-config-next
```

This is particularly helpful when working with Next.js for the first time as the
linting will highlight specific Next.js only optimizations that are recommended
(try adding an `<img/>` tag in your `index.tsx` page to see in it action).

```json showLineNumbers hl="10, 23...26"
// package.json
{
  "name": "nextjs-themeui-ts-template",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,

  },

    "extends": "next"
  }

```
