In certain scenarios, we might want to have a little bit more control over the
`children` being rendered in a functional component. This can be achieved with a
combination of `React.Children.map()` and `React.cloneElement()` which allows us
to dynamically pass additional props to child elements that maybe only the parent
component would know about.

I found this to be quite useful when working with a sub-component pattern with
[JSX Dot Notation](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#using-dot-notation-for-jsx-type)
where a single component delivers multiple sub-components that need to adhere to a
certain hierarchy during usage. This comes with the slight caveat of not exactly
knowing this hierarchy before hand without reading through some documentation.

A simple example would be nesting a `<div>` element inside a `<p>` element, which
is clearly invalid HTML and the console will throw an error for that mistake. 
Similarly for functional components, we can add in some defensive programming by
throwing a warning to the console whenever our component encounters a child 
element that should not be rendered when using this method of mapping Children.

```typescript showLineNumbers
import React from "react";

type MyProps = React.PropsWithChildren<{
  // add any props here
}>;

export function RenderChildrenWithProps({ children }: MyProps) {
  return React.Children.map(children, (child, index) => {
    if (React.isValidElement(child)) {
      const { type } = child;
      const componentName = (type as React.FC).displayName;

      // can validate descendants if needed
      if (componentName !== "CustomComponentName") {
        console.warn(
          "This component should not be rendered here",
          componentName
        );
      }

      // pass any dynamic props you would need
      return React.cloneElement(child, { index });
    }
  });
}
```
