# Frontend Developer Since Yesterday

I'm Thinh (pronounced like _Tin_), a full-stack coding bootcamp graduate, currently working as a frontend web developer. I plan on sharing sweet tweets and occasial blog posts about
anything interested I've learned on my site or on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/gthinh).
